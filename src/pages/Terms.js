              Welcome to SriAstroVeda. By booking or purchasing any astrology service through our website, you agree to the following terms.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-4">1. About Our Services</h2>
            <p>
              Our astrology readings, horoscope reports, numerology analyses, and compatibility guidance are based on authentic Vedic astrology principles. Every prediction is prepared using the birth details you provide (date, time, and place of birth). Accuracy depends on the correctness of this information.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-4">2. Guidance, Not Absolute Guarantee</h2>
            <p>
              Our services are designed to offer insights, direction, and clarity — they are not a substitute for medical, legal, or financial advice. Decisions you take after receiving your report are entirely your responsibility.

            <p>
              We aim to deliver all reports within 24–48 working hours after confirming your order. In rare cases of delay (due to unforeseen reasons), we will inform you promptly.

            <p>
              Since astrology is a personalized service, reports are non-refundable once preparation begins. If you cancel before we start work, we may offer a partial refund at our discretion.
